# What is Life Coaching?
Life coaching is the use of introspection to bring clarity, discover what holds one back from achieving goals, and spark actions that lead to a happier, transformed life. With life coaching, you can achieve all kinds of goals, big or small, whether you're embarking on something brand new or looking to reawaken that which lies dormant.

# Who do I serve?
I have a heart for young go-getters who want to achieve mental wholeness and a fulfilling life. I focus on areas of my clients’ lives where they wish to increase their authenticity and fulfill their passions. My clients are typically people who desire and are seeking a life and interests that fulfill them.
