## Who am I?

My name is Kayla, and I am a professional in the field of neurotechnology. More importantly, however, I am an advocate for good brain health. As someone who has experienced depression and anxiety, I understand just how important it is to maintain good brain health. 



I've started this blog in order to share my knowledge and thoughts about brain health with an ultimate goal of sharing new and helpful information with everyone who comes across my content.

​

The information I provide is a combination of personal research endeavors, lessons from experience, and my own thoughts, so it's alright to take some of what I say with a grain of salt.

​

Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoy what I have to offer!
